### **Learning Support in Mathematics (LSM)**
#### **LSM -  Primary 1 and Primary 2**
Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) is an early intervention effort aimed at providing additional support to pupils who do not have foundational numeracy skills and knowledge to cope with the Primary 1 and Primary 2 Math Curriculum.Â Identified students will be supported by an LSM Teacher for 8 periods a week through activity-based lessons focusing on small successes to build on their motivation.
