### **Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**


Our school embarked on the ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy) journey in 2017. Different groups of pupils experienced this pedagogical approach. A few of   
our teachers have undergone and are undergoing training sessions on its implementation process for various topics such as Whole Numbers, Fractions and Word Problems. Besides implementing what they have learnt in class, the teachers also conduct sharing sessions with the other Mathematics teachers.

ICAN emphasises the importance of concrete learning to enable pupils to make better sense of their learning. Pupils have lots of fun in their mathematics learning as they gain confidence and motivation in learning the subject.
