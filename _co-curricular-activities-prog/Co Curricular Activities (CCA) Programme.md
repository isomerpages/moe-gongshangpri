### **Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Programme**
The CCA Programme forms an integral part in the holistic education of all Gongshangers. We strongly believe in providing an all-round education for every child to discover their interests and maximize his optimal potential. In addition, the CCA programme provides opportunities for students to exhibit our school values and to live up to the school vision of “Active Learner, Confident Learners, Gracious Citizens.”&nbsp; It is also a platform for students to develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school and for friendships to be forged and characters to be moulded.&nbsp;

The CCA programme aims to:<br>
1\. Develop in students knowledge, skills, values and attitudes related to their chosen CCA.<br>
2\. Foster and develop qualities of self-discipline, team spirit, leadership and group loyalty.<br>
3\. Inculcate in students core values, social and emotional competencies and the emerging 21st century competencies.<br>
4\. Help students to develop a passion for a particular activity, be it a sport or a musical pursuit, which they can continue to pursue in their adulthood.

The CCA programme in Gongshang Primary School is conducted during curriculum hours for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6 on Wednesday mornings. For students who are representing the school in their various areas, Monday afternoon is another day set aside for their extra training or practice to hone their skills or knowledge.&nbsp;

To cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students, the school provides a spectrum of activities which can be broadly categorized into 4 groups, namely: Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Uniformed Group and Clubs and Societies.

**From 2022, CCA will be conducted outside curriculum time for Primary 3 to 6 pupils. CCA will be conducted from 2.30pm to 4.00pm&nbsp; on Wednesdays and for selected pupils, 3.00pm to 5.00pm on Mondays.**
