### **Modern Dance**
Warmest greetings!  <br>
Modern Dance will give students the opportunity to express their imagination and creativity through movement. Our dancers will also gain poise, confidence and creative thinking skills that will help them throughout their academic pursuits. The instructor will prepare the students for performances in school as well as in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). We hope our dancers will have a fruitful and enriching experience this year!
