### **String Ensemble**
Our String Ensemble is a music group that comprises of pupils with a passion for string instruments such as violin and cello. The CCA hones the musical skills such as listening, blends and ensemble coordination. Through participation in performances, our members develops values such as team work, discipline and showmanship. As a musical group, the String Ensemble aims to promote an appreciation for the Arts, culture and heritage.

The String Ensemble performs for school events every year on Teachersâ€™ Day. Every two years, we will participate in the Singapore Youth Festival Presentation (SYF)
