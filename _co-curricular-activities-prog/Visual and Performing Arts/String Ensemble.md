### **String Ensemble**
Our String Ensemble team is made up of violinists and cellists.

In 2018, our budding musicians did our school proud by representing us at the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2018 achieving the Certificate of Commendation.  Unfortunately we were not able to take part in the Singapore Youth Festival during 2020 due to the covid situation then.

Our members are working hard on the dynamics, pitching, rhythm, musical expressions in performing the pieces for SYF Arts Presentation 2022. Every training session focuses on values of team work, discipline and showmanship.
