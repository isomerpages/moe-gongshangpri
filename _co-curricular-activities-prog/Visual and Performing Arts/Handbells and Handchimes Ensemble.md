### **Handbells and Handchimes Ensemble**
Since the inception of Handbells and Handchimes in 2005, we have been participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and had clinched various awards. In 2018, we clinched the Certificate of Accomplishment. This is made possible through the pupils’ hard work and diligence as well as the strong support we receive from parents as our partners. We look forward to our performance and our strong parental support for the SYF in April 2022.

In Handbells and Handchimes Ensemble, we strongly believe in teamwork and valuing individual’s strengths. Through this, we are able to achieve excellence in our performances.
