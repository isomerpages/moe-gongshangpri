### **Handbells and Handchimes Ensemble**
Since the inception of Handbells and Handchimes in 2005, we have been participating in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and had clinched various awards. This is made possible through the pupils’ hard work and diligence as well as the strong support we have received from parents as our partners. We look forward to parents’ continued support for their children’s participation in CCA as well as school’s performances.
