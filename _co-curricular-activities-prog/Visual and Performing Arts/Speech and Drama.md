### **Speech and Drama**
#### **Lights, camera, action!**
This fun and exciting new CCA will give students the opportunity to express their imagination and creativity using various drama techniques. The students will get a chance to go for a professional drama production at least once a year and learn from the experts in the drama scene. Students will also prepare for their own productions in school as well as in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF). Through these activities, we hope to develop our students into competent communicators and confident users of the English Language.

**Some of the highlights of our club activities include:**
* Script writing – to learn how to write a simple screenplay
* Educational Games – to build rapport with one another through games such as Conversational Cards and debates
* Public speaking – to build confidence to take the stage and present their ideas
* ICT – to use technological tools to express and share their ideas
