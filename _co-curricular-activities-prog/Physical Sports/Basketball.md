### **Basketball**
Through Basketball CCA, our pupils will learn fundamental basketball skills, basketball rules and regulations, territorial invasion games concept as well as develop physical fitness. Besides learning skills and know-how, the teachers believe in imparting values required to shape our pupilsâ€™ character and thus, we place much emphasis on discipline and nurturing sporting values such as perseverance, resilience and teamwork. In the pursuit of the very best in each and every pupil, pupils will also have ample opportunities for leadership development.
