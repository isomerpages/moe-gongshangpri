#### **History**
Gongshang Gladiators has a history of excellence in the National Track and Field meets. We have since become the school's niche CCA. Over the years, we have groomed and produced numerous athletes who went on to compete in the international arena. Under the guidance of our teachers and coaches, we have been able to nurture and inculcate in our athletes the values of being a sports boy or sports girl.

#### **About Us**
Track and Field is a Co-Curricular Activity that can strengthen character and provide a holistic education. We seek to create a culture of sporting excellence and cultivate in athletes an appreciation for running. Through various drills and exercises, we develop the athletes' loco-motor skills, sense of balance, agility, strength and speed which will enhance their overall performance.  

Pupils who show potential are provided with additional training to harness their talent so as to be able to represent the school at Track and Field Meets. We also hope to promote team camaraderie and social cohesion among the team through relay events.
