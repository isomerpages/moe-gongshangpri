### **Modular Sports**
The Modular Sports CCA focuses on physical activities and games like Jump Jam, Rope Skipping and Sport Stacking. Previously, our pupils had taken part in competitions like the Inter-School Challenge Event for the World Sport Stacking Association (WSSA) OPL Sport Stacking Challenge, Rope Skipping National Championships and Jump Jam Competition. This year we will be learning how to play Floorball in term 1 by learning basic ball control, passing and shooting.Â   

The activities and games help to develop teamwork and foster interaction amongst the pupils and their peers through the learning of new skills. The pupils also encourage one another in acquiring and improving in the skills for the different activities. They deepen values like perseverance and respect when they work together in teams.
