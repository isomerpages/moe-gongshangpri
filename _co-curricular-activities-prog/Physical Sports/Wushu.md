### **Wushu**

_Success is the sum of small efforts, repeated day in and day out._

With determination and hard work, our school Wushu team has been improving steadily over the years despite a short history of only seventeen years. 

At the National Primary School Wushu Championship in 2021, our school team did us proud by achieving a total of 4 bronze medals for individual events. Due to Covid situation the group events have to be cancelled. However, both our junior and senior groups for Group Wushu and Group Weapons, have trained hard for their events, we are very proud of them. It is our belief that our Wushu team would continue to grow from strength to strength and scale greater heights in the years to come with the help of our teachers, coaches and the ardent support of the parents.  

The COVID pandemic situation brought our training plans to a temporary halt in 2021, but not for long. Undeterred, our teachers and coaches went online, conducting training sessions via zoom. 

This year, our training sessions have been resumed with safe management measures. We look forward to an exciting year ahead!
