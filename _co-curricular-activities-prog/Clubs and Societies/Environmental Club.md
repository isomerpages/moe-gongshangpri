### **Environmental Club**
In Environmental Science Club, members will learn about the environment and science phenomenon through using various scientific equipment and investigative techniques.  Through these projects, our members will acquire important life skills such as working collaboratively, problem-solving and teamwork. 

Our Club also participates in advocating environmental awareness and through the work we do, members will learn to show care and acquire a sense of responsibility for their environment. For example, members will carry out scientific investigations and explore how they can play a part through hands-on ‘green’ activities. Through these authentic activities, members will learn the subject in a fun and experiential way.
