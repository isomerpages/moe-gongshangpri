### **Environmental Club**
In Environmental Club, we focus on investigating our environment through using various scientific equipment to acquire important life skills to work collaboratively with their peers in their projects. The members will learn to promote environmental awareness and care for the environment through the 3Rs- reduce, reuse and recycle.    

At each weekly meeting, the members learn how they can play a part in caring for the environment through hands-on ‘green’ activities such as craft work using recycled materials, collecting recyclable materials, gardening to increase biodiversity in the school ground etc. The members will have the opportunity to participate in hands-on and challenging science-related activities that demonstrate scientific concepts and learn the subject in a fun and enjoyable way.
