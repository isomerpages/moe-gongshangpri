### **Environmental Science Club**


In Environmental Science Club, members will learn about the environment and science phenomenon through using various scientific equipment and investigative techniques.&nbsp;Our club also participates in activities advocating environmental awarenesss. For example, members will carry out scientific investigations and explore how they can play a part through hands-on ‘green’ activities. Through these authentic activities, members will learn the subject in a fun and experiential way.

**Objectives of CCA:**

*   To develop care and acquire a sense of responsibility for their environment
*   To acquire important life skills such as working collaboratively, problem-solving and teamwork.
