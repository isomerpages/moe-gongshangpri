### **School-On-Air Rediffusion (SOAR)**
**S**CHOOL **O**N **A**IR **R**EDIFFUSION **(SOAR)**

The school is equipped with a state of the art studio that revolutionizes the way language is taught and learnt, providing students with innovative platforms to apply their learning in the real world as well as to learn a set of media skills. Teachers can now be actively involved in the holistic development of the students beyond the boundaries of the school.

SOAR aims to enhance character development in the students and at the same time, focusing on the physical, emotional and social health of the students through the provision of a platform for them to express their feelings and interact with one another meaningfully.

It also aims to cultivate an interest in the Chinese Language amongst the students and providing the opportunity for students with the ability and interest to go further to master the language and develop a deeper feel and association with both the culture that underpins the language, deepen students’ appreciation of the Chinese language and literature as well as the Chinese culture.
