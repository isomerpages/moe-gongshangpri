### **Fathers@Gongshang**
#### **About Us**
**Fathers@Gongshang**&nbsp;is part of the Singapore's nationwide initiative of 'Dads for Life' Programme, where we encourage all fathers to share a mission to "Inspire, Mobilize and Involve" fathers to become good influencers in their childrenâ€™s lives for life.&nbsp;  
  
Being an active father is challenging, but all the more fulfilling.&nbsp;**Fathers@Gongshang**&nbsp;organise events and workshops to encourage Father-and-Child bonding.&nbsp;In a case where there is an absence of a father figure, any related male role model of the child is eligible to sign up for our activities.&nbsp;  
  
Fathers@Gongshang warmly welcomes all Fathers interested to volunteer their services!&nbsp;  
Do contact us via our&nbsp;&nbsp;[Fathers@Gongshang Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/fathersat.gongshang)&nbsp;where photographs of past events are posted.
  
You are welcome to join us for any&nbsp;**Fathers@Gongshang**&nbsp;activity. Fathers, who are interested to help in logistics or any brainstorming, please contact&nbsp;Kelvin Leow, Chairperson of&nbsp;**Fathers@Gongshang**, [kelvinleowting@gmail.com](mailto:kelvinleowting@gmail.com) or 91081550.
