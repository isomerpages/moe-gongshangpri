### **Home-based Learning (General Information)**
Home-based learning serves to ensure continuity of learning for students in a meaningful and engaging manner. Work is not confined to e-learning. It could include offline assignments and hard copies of assignments, readings from textbooks, worksheets. 
The learning activities will be designed to allow pupils to complete meaningful tasks independently. Parents/Guardians are strongly encouraged to support their child/ward by providing a conducive environment at home. 

For nation-wide Home-based learning, to minimize disruptions arising from delays in logging in or lags in loading pages for online learning, the school will put in a deliberate effort to stagger online lessons across levels and subjects. Should pupils continue to face difficulties in accessing online learning resources, we seek parents’ understanding and suggest that the child does his/her written work (if any) first.

During school operating hours, for learning contents, students should contact the form teacher or subject teacher via ClassDojo or email.
