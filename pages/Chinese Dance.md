|  Preparing for SYF 2022	  |  Rehearsing in our new dance room |

Our Chinese Dance members comprise of pupils from P3 to P6, who join us with no or little dance background. Our members go through proper dance warm-up techniques and body conditioning, which aim to increase flexibility and develop proper posture, balance and coordination.   

Members will be exposed to different dance moves and they will develop self- confidence as they perform on stage and learn how to work together as a team. Their weekly practice sessions will also help them to acquire positive values like self-discipline, perseverance and commitment. Members will get to be part of performance for school and grass-root events as well as competitions. Our Chinese dancers have been doing well in the biannual SYF competitions, they have been receiving certificates of distinction for the past years. Way to go, girls! This year, the girls will be taking part in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (Chinese Dance) 2022. All the best to you, girls!
