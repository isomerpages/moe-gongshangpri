<h3><strong>Home-based Learning (General Information)</strong></h3>
<p>Home-based learning serves to ensure continuity of learning for students
in a meaningful and engaging manner. Work is not confined to e-learning.
It could include offline assignments and hard copies of assignments, readings
from textbooks, worksheets. The learning activities will be designed to
allow pupils to complete meaningful tasks independently. Parents/Guardians
are strongly encouraged to support their child/ward by providing a conducive
environment at home.</p>
<p>For nation-wide Home-based learning, to minimize disruptions arising from
delays in logging in or lags in loading pages for online learning, the
school will put in a deliberate effort to stagger online lessons across
levels and subjects. Should pupils continue to face difficulties in accessing
online learning resources, we seek parents’ understanding and suggest that
the child does his/her written work (if any) first.</p>
<h5><strong>Helplines</strong></h5>
<p>During school operating hours, for learning contents, students should
contact the form teacher or subject teacher via ClassDojo or email.</p>
<h5><strong>SLS Support for Home-based Learning</strong></h5>

such as password reset and unlocking of accounts.</p>
