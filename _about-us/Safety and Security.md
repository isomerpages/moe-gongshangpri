<p>Your child’s safety is our foremost concern. Our policies place the safety/security
of the child as priority. Please read the following carefully and we look
forward to your partnership in making school a safe place for the children.
We seek your understanding and cooperation when a staff member approaches/
engages you for safety-related checks.</p>
