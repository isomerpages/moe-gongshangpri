<p>A Singaporean child between the age of 7 to 16 years is automatically
given an Edusave Account. A sum of money is credited into the account in
January every year, until he/she is 16 years old. He/she will receive a
yearly statement of accounts.</p>
<p>The money in the Edusave Account can be used for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>2nd–Tier miscellaneous fee; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enrichment programmes organized by the school.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After 16 years old, the money in the account can be used if the child
is still in school/Junior College or Tertiary Institutions. To check the
balance in your child’s Edusave account, you may call the Edusave Phone
Scheme Hotline at 6260 0777.</p>
