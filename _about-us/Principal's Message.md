<h4><strong>Our Gongshang Story</strong></h4>
<p><strong>It is with great excitement and pride that we welcome the 2025 school year at Gongshang Primary School, marking a significant milestone - our 105th anniversary! Founded in January 1920 by Mr. Shi Su, the school was initially established as The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Continuation School. As the 11th principal of this esteemed school, I am deeply privileged to lead a community with such a rich history of educational excellence.</strong>

<p>The legacy of Gongshang Primary School is built on the dedication, hard
work and passion of the generations of students, school leaders, staff,
alumni and parents who have contributed to its success. I would like to
express my heartfelt gratitude to the previous 10 principals, whose strong
leadership and vision have shaped Gongshang Primary School into the established
institution it is today. I am honored to continue building upon their legacy.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of our success is the strong partnership we share with our
dedicated stakeholdersâ€”our parents, Parent Support Group, Alumni, School
Advisory Committee and community partners. I extend my deepest thanks to
these valued partners whose unwavering support plays an integral role in
the growth and success of our students and school.</p>
<p>Gongshang Primary School has been a nurturing environment where students
are inspired to learn, lead, and develop into well-rounded individuals.
As we look to the future, we recognize that the world around us is rapidly
evolving, driven by accelerated technological advancements, presenting
both challenges and exciting opportunities. Our vision of <strong>Active Learners, Confident Leaders, and Gracious Citizens</strong> reflects
our commitment to equipping our students with the skills, mindset, and
resilience necessary to thrive in this dynamic and uncertain world. We
foster adaptability, creativity and collaboration, nurturing our students
to be learners who embrace each day with curiosity and passion, leaders
who face challenges with courage and resilience, and citizens who act with
purpose and compassion.</p>
<p>At the heart of our school are four core values that guide and shape our
community - <strong>Perseverance, Thrift, Integrity and Respect</strong>.
These values empower our students to face challenges with determination,
manage resources wisely, maintain a strong sense of right and wrong, appreciate
and treat others with kindness and sensitivity. By embodying these values,
our students stay grounded and are enabled to positively influence their
peers and contribute meaningfully to the communities around them.</p>
<p>Our dedicated educators and staff are committed to fostering a caring
and enabling school environment where every child is encouraged to enjoy
learning and forge strong relationships. I look forward to working alongside
all of you to ensure that Gongshang Primary School continues to be a place
where every child feels valued, inspired, and empowered to face the future
with confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To our Gongshangers, embrace every opportunity to learn, grow, and challenge
yourselves. Be curious, be kind, and believe in your own strengths. You
all have immense potential, so give it a try and strive to reach new heights!
Remember, you are supported by your parents, peers, teachers and community
around you, all ready to help you along the way.</p>
<p>As we celebrate our 105th anniversary, we honor the past while looking
forward to the future. We welcome you to be part of our vibrant community!
I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to partnering
with all of you to shape the next memorable chapters of our Gongshang story.</p>
