<h5><strong>SCHOOL-HOME PARTNERSHIP</strong></h5>
<p><strong>1. How can I communicate with my child/ward's teachers?</strong>
</p>
<p>Your child/ward will receive a letter from his/her Form Teacher at the
start of the academic year. In the letter, the Form Teacher will provide
his/her email address. Do keep the teacher's letter for reference. You
may also make use of the student's Learning Journal to communicate with
the teacher through handwritten notes. You may also call the General Office
and leave a message for the teacher concerned.</p>

<p>Students will only be allowed to leave the school premises early if accompanied
by an authorized adult. The adult fetching the child must report to the
General Office and fill in the necessary form(s) before leaving the school

you need to fetch your child/ward early. Students are not allowed to leave
the school on their own even if they have valid reasons to do so.</p>
<p><strong>3. Can my child/ward bring a mobile phone to school?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school discourages students from bringing their mobile phones to school

be responsible for any loss or damage.</p>
