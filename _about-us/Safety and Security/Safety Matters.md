<p><strong>Walking in and out of school</strong>
<br>Your child should use the sheltered walkways for walking in/out of school
and should be alert to construction works and heavy plant equipment that
are within or near the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Crossing the Road</strong>
<br>Your child should always use the over-head bridges or proper pedestrian
crossings.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lightning Warning System (LWS)</strong>
<br>This consists of a siren and four revolving yellow warning lights installed
around the school. If there is a lightning risk, the LWS will be activated
and all personnel are to go under shelter and stay away from open spaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Encountering Strangers</strong>
<br>Please remind your child not to speak to strangers, accept lifts or gifts
from them or to go anywhere with them. Your child should immediately report
any such encounter to a school staff.</p>
