<p><strong>Walking in and out of school</strong>
<br>Your child should use the sheltered walkways for walking in/out of school
and should be alert to construction works and heavy plant equipment that
are within or near the school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Crossing the Road</strong>
<br>Your child should always use the over-head bridges or proper pedestrian
crossings.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Cycling to School</strong>
<br>Your child should take the necessary safety precautions, including but
notlimited to the following:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Before cycling to school, always make sure that the bicycle is in good
working condition. Bicycles should ideally be fitted with front and rear
lights and a bell. You or your child should ensure that the bicycle’s brakes,
chains, tires, lights and bell are well-maintained and are in good working
order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child should always wear protective gear, such as a helmet, and proper
shoes (if there are shoelaces, they should be properly tied) to protect
against injuries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your child should be reminded not to use his or her mobile phone, even
with an in-ear attachment, or listen to music through earphones while cycling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your child is advised to secure his or her bicycle at the bicycle racks
located on the school premises. The school will not be responsible for
the loss of, or any damage to, your child’s bicycle.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Lightning Warning System (LWS)</strong>
<br>This consists of a siren and four revolving yellow warning lights installed
around the school. If there is a lightning risk, the LWS will be activated
and all personnel are to go under shelter and stay away from open spaces.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Encountering Strangers</strong>
<br>Please remind your child not to speak to strangers, accept lifts or gifts
from them or to go anywhere with them. Your child should immediately report
any such encounter to a school staff.</p>
