<h3><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture every child to be a concerned and gracious citizen, a confident
leader with the right values.</p>
<p>The aim of education is the nurturing of the whole child. There are five
main dimensions to every child:</p>
<p>1. Intellectual
<br>2. Physical
<br>3. Moral
<br>4. Social
<br>5. Emotional</p>
<p>These dimensions are closely linked to one another. Through Character
and Citizenship Education (CCE) the department facilitates the development
of our students across these five dimensions. In CCE, we want our students
to learn to be responsible learners as well as to develop an awareness
and understanding of their roles in shaping the future of our nation.</p>
