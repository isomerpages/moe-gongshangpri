<h3><strong>Parent Volunteers (PV)</strong></h3>
<p>Gongshang Primary School values the contributions of our PVs.</p>
<p>The PV scheme provides parents who have volunteered their time and effort
in a primary school through priority during the P1 registration exercise.</p>
<p>Specifically, the children of PVs can register at the Phase 2B stage where:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the parent has joined Gongshang Primary School as a parent volunteer not
later than 1 July of the year before P1 registration and has given at least
40 hours of voluntary service to the school by 30 June of the year of P1
registration, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parent is endorsed as an active community leader.</p>
