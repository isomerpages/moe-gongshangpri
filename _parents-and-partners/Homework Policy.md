<blockquote>
<p><em>Homework refers to any learning activity that schools require students to complete outside of curriculum time, regardless of the mode of delivery (i.e. pen-and-paper, virtual / online). This includes assignments and projects but not revision of schoolwork or studying for tests and examinations.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Rationale for Homework</strong></h4>
<p>Homework, when used appropriately, can reinforce students’ learning, provide
feedback on their progress and cultivate a healthy disposition towards
continual learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>Effective use of homework can</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>reinforce learning and deepen understanding of lessons taught;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>allow students to regularly practise, and apply skills and concepts taught;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop good study skills and habits; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>encourage greater ownership and responsibility for independent learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Homework also provides parents with</em></strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>timely information on the learning progress of their child; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>opportunity to be involved in the child’s learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>General Considerations</strong></h4>
<p>Homework is assigned with the following considerations:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Holistic development</u>
<br>Students need a balanced life with adequate time for family bonding, social
activities, personal interests and rest;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Balance</u>
<br>Students' overall workload and the competing demands on their time (e.g.
CCA, competitions, enrichment classes, preparation for upcoming Weighted
Assessments, tests and examinations) are accounted for; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Ability</u>
<br>Students are provided with homework that is age-appropriate, and differentiated
by academic levels.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Guidelines for Homework Hours</strong></h4>

<p>Subject teachers will coordinate their assignment of homework to ensure
students are not overloaded.</p>
<p>EL and MTL departments will coordinate weekly spelling so that they do
not fall on the same day of the week.</p>
<p>Reading is essential and it is expected that all students read daily.
Therefore reading assignments (e.g. reading aloud to others, reading quietly)
may also be given as homework.</p>
<p>Tasks or assignments given through the Student Learning Space (SLS) that
would require students to complete outside of curriculum time will also
constitute as homework.</p>
<p>Teachers will not assign homework to be completed on Public Holidays as
students could be involved in the celebration of festivals, spending time
with their loved ones or taking a break from formal learning.</p>
<p>The school is mindful that school holidays are meant for students to take
a break from formal learning and they should therefore not be given excessive
homework. If homework is to be given during the school holidays, the daily
homework load will not be more than 50% of the daily load given during
the school week.</p>
<h4><strong>Types of Homework</strong></h4>
<p>Homework can be thought of as four types which serve different purposes:</p>

<h4><strong>Roles and Responsibilities</strong></h4>
<p>Students and parents both play important roles in enduring that homework
serves its intended purposes.</p>
<p><strong><em>Students </em></strong>should</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>understand the purpose of homework and what is expected of them;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use “My Learning Journal” to keep track of homework instructions and deadlines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>manage time well to ensure that homework is completed and submitted on
time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>give his / her best effort in completing homework; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>review feedback from teachers on homework submitted.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Parents </em></strong>should</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>co-create with your child a home environment conducive for studying and
completion of homework (i.e. an area with good lighting and space for studying,
and is free of distractions);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>supervise and provide support for your child’s learning;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan set a regular schedule with your child for completing homework for
each day;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>inculcate a healthy habit with your child in checking their learning journals
daily for the homework assigned so as to help monitor the progress and
completion status of the homework;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reinforce good study habits and attitudes by encouraging and motivating
your child;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be mindful of the stresses arising from school homework and out-of-school
activities, and help your child prioritise his / her time among these activities;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>work in partnership with the school and teachers to support your child’s
learning and development.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Non-completion of Homework</strong></h4>
<p>Teachers will work with students to find out the reasons for any non-submission
of homework. Intervention strategies to support the student in this area
will be based on the reasons and if need be, a parent-teacher conference
will be arranged.</p>
<p>If a student is medically excused from school for an extended length of
time, arrangements can be made on how the student can be supported with
homework and other areas of academic needs.</p>
