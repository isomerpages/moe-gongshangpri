阅读之星－每个学段末，老师会选出阅读最多华文书籍的学生成为阅读之星。这是第一学段的阅读之星。

Reading Star – at the end of each term, teachers will select the pupil who read the most number of Chinese books.

#### **Appreciation of Chinese Classical Novels 四大名著赏析**
The Four Great Classical Novels (Dream of the Red Chamber, Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Journey to the West) of the Ming and early Qing dynasties, represented a pinnacle of classical Chinese fiction.  Our department aim to create awareness among the pupils, by selecting highlights from the novels via our Reading Program.
