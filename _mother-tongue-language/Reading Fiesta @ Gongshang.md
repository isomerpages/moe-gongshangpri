### **Reading Fiesta @ Gongshang**
The school had organised Reading Fiesta for the lower primary pupils.  The event aims to raise the awareness of the importance of reading story books and to encourage active reading among our pupils to develop their English and Mother Tongue Language competencies in reading, writing and oral literacy.  It also provides the platform for parents to bond and interact with the child through fun reading and language activities.  With a collaborative effort from the Media Resource Library, MTL Department, EL Department and National Library Board (NLB), the event was successfully organised.
