<p>At MK, we believe preschool children are curious, active, and competent
learners. They are keen to make sense of the world around them, and they
learn best through active learning. &nbsp; To ensure a meaningful learning
experience for your child, we carry out activities that have a distinctive
Singapore flavour. These activities are intentionally planned to create
an authentic and relevant learning experiences. &nbsp; MK’s curriculum
and programmes are based on the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework
that guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore. &nbsp;
Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes: the HI-Light Programme,
and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and MTL. Moreover, each term
at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder project.</p>
<h3>HI-Light Programme</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;HI-Light Programme&nbsp;is designed to support the&nbsp;holistic
development&nbsp;of children by nurturing in them&nbsp;values, social and
emotional skills&nbsp;and&nbsp;learning dispositions,&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;knowledge
and skills&nbsp;across the following&nbsp;five learning areas&nbsp;through
an&nbsp;integrated approach:</p>
<p>1. Aesthetics and creative expression</p>
<p>2. Discovery of the world</p>
<p>3. Health, safety and motor skills development</p>
<p>4. Language and literacy</p>
<p>5. Numeracy</p>
<h3>Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language (MTL)</h3>
<p>In MK, we focus on developing children’s listening, speaking and early
literacy skills in both English and their MTL (i.e. Chinese, Malay, or
Tamil language). Emphasis is also placed on getting them to enjoy these
languages. With these in mind, the Starlight Literacy Programme nurtures
your child’s language skills through Big Books, songs, rhymes and games
set in the local context. As bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s
education system, we intentionally nurture bilingualism in our children.
By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a
daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them
for language learning in later years.</p>
<h3>Weeks of Wonder (WoW) projects</h3>
<p>WoW projects provide children with an opportunity to work together to
investigate topics that interest them. In a year, children complete 2 WoW
projects in English and another 2 in their MTL. As they go through the
process of finding the answers to their questions, the children</p>
