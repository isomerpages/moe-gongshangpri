### **MK Curriculum**

At MK, we believe preschool children are curious, active, and competent learners. They are keen to make sense of the world around them, and they learn best through active learning.   To ensure a meaningful learning experience for your child, we carry out activities that have a distinctive Singapore flavour. These activities are intentionally planned to create an authentic and relevant learning experiences.   MK’s curriculum and programmes are based on the Nurturing Early Learners (NEL) Framework that guides the development of kindergarten programmes in Singapore.   Our curriculum comprises 2 flagship programmes: the HI-Light Programme, and Starlight Literacy Programme for English and MTL. Moreover, each term at MK will conclude in a Weeks of Wonder project.

#### **HI-Light Programme**
The HI-Light Programme supports the holistic development of children across six learning areas through an integrated approach to learning.  
The six areas are:  

*   Aesthetics and creative expression
*   Discovery of the world
*   Language and literacy
*   Motor skills development
*   Numeracy
*   Social and emotional development

The areas correspond to those outlined in the NEL framework.

#### **Starlight Literacy Programme for English and Mother Tongue Language (MTL)**

In MK, we focus on developing children’s listening, speaking and early literacy skills in both English and their MTL (i.e. Chinese, Malay, or Tamil language). Emphasis is also placed on getting them to enjoy these languages. With these in mind, the Starlight Literacy Programme nurtures your child’s language skills through Big Books, songs, rhymes and games set in the local context.   As bilingualism is a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system, we intentionally nurture bilingualism in our children. By using their MTL to communicate with teachers and their friends on a daily basis, children build a strong foundation that will prepare them for language learning in later years.

#### **Weeks of Wonder (WoW) projects**
WoW projects provide children with an opportunity to work together to investigate topics that interest them. In a year, children complete 2 WoW projects in English and another 2 in their MTL. As they go through the process of finding the answers to their questions, the children  

*   collaborate with one another, 
*   develop problem-solving, process, and investigative skills,
*   communicate effectively in English and their MTL, 
*   experience the joy of self-motivated learning, and
*   build confidence, among others.
