<p>Welcome to Scouting, a Worldwide Youth organisation. The Singapore Scout
Association (SSA) is an established youth movement dating back to 1910.
It is a full member of the World Organisation of the Scout Movement (WOSM),
which numbers approximately 54 million Scouts across 172 National Organisations
as of 2022. The SSA, a registered charity in Singapore, offers a robust
system of a non-formal and value-based educational programme to support
the development of young people to become responsible and active citizens.
As one of nine uniformed groups in Singapore, its programmes are aligned
to the 21st Century Competencies (21CC) and Character &amp; Citizenship
Education (CCE2021) frameworks promulgated by the Ministry of Education
to encourage the holistic physical, mental, spiritual, and social development
of youth.</p>
<p><strong>Our programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>The Scout Movement is very much part and parcel of the Singapore Education
System. Indeed the movement is an integral partner that helps its members
build character and leadership. Scouting provides an informal education
to develop individuals for purposeful and responsible adulthood, always
prepared to serve God, country and humanity. Through the processes, scouting
helps to inculcate among other things, the foundation values and character
building which is very much in line of MOE's recent focus on values and
character education. Using the Scout Method that empowers every member
to be the principal agent of his/her development as a self-reliant, supportive,
responsible and committed person, every programme/activity is planned to
encourage individuals to be actively involved in and be responsible for
their own development. The Scouting Method also encourages the holistic
physical, mental, spiritual and social development with a strong emphasis
on duty to country.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives of CCA:</strong>
</p>
<p>Cub Scouts (Cubs) is for boys and girls aged 7 – 12 years old.</p>
<p>1. The objective of the Cub Scout programme is to develop the child in
an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating as well
as providing challenges for the child to face and overcome.</p>
<p>A Cub Scout Group (also known as a Cub Pack) gathers weekly or fortnightly
and is divided into groups called Sixes and led by a Sixer. A Sixer is
a Cub of good standing who carries out tasks that have been set by their
Akela (Cub Scout Leader). Cubs learn to manage themselves and take care
of their peers. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership experience.</p>
<p>2. Activities are typically carried out in Sixes. This encourages Cubs
to take ownership of themselves and grow through peer-led learning. Pack
meetings are opportunities for adventures, learning life skills, hikes,
outdoor cooking, camps, games, shelter-building, knotting, craftwork, and
other Scouting skills – all while making new friends.</p>
<p>Games – Games are part of every pack meeting (CCA session) &amp; are typically
carried out in Sixes. This provide opportunities for every Cub to contribute
&amp; grow together with their Six.</p>
<p>Adventures – Cubs are not sit-down creatures; they are active go-getters!
They are at an age where they are adventurous &amp; excitable. They easily
pick up new skills &amp; push their own boundaries. Cub Scout activities
build onto these, &amp; one will find that Cubs are naturally inspired,
curious &amp; raring to go!</p>
<p>Community &amp; Environmental Involvement – Cubs learn about the environment
&amp; regularly participate in meaningful projects to improve their surroundings.
They are helpers in their homes &amp; communities. The Scout Law &amp;
Promise guides them to do their best to be of service to others.</p>
<p>3. The Cub Scout programme is based on The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.
Taking inspiration from the story, Cubs are taught to be prepared for difficult
situations and to do so calmly and methodically.</p>
<p>As the 1st line of the Scout Promise reads, “I promise to do my best!”
– so every boy and girl Cub will endeavour to overcome difficulties, setbacks
and challenges, to do their very best in all things and at all times!</p>
