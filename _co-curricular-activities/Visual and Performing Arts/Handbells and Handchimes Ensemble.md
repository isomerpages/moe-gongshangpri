<h3><strong>Handbells and Handchimes Ensemble</strong></h3>
<p>The Handbell and Handchime Ensemble is a unique performing art group which
leverages on teamwork. Each member is responsible for ringing his/her assigned
bells for some particular notes in a piece of music. Playing the handbells
boosts auditory skills such as sound awareness, stimulates the brain and
builds up memory and gross coordination skills. As each ringer is an integral
part of the musical ensemble, members of the ensemble have to work together
and be attentive to one another to create successful music. The harmonious
chimes of the handbells and handchimes are the result of an intimate collaboration
and concerted effort among all members.</p>
