<h3><strong>Modern Dance</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to GSPS Modern Dance Club. Our Club comprises of Primary 3 to
Primary 6 students who have a passion for dance. Our dancers are given
the opportunity to discover and explore the different dance techniques
and choreography in various genres including Hip Hop, K-Pop, Modern and
Contemporary Dance. Here at GSPS Modern Dance, our dancers learn to build
their resilience and discipline as they synthesize movements and dance
techniques into their performances. They will be exposed to various activities
and performances at both internal and external events, such as our Teacherâ€™s
Day celebration and our Annual Awards Presentation. Our dancers will also
get to participate in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation.</p>
