<h3><strong>Track and Field</strong></h3>
<p>Gongshang Gladiators has a history of excellence in the National Track
and Field meets. Over the years, we have groomed and produced numerous
athletes who went on to compete in the international arena. Under the guidance
of our teachers and coaches, we have been able to nurture and inculcate
in our athletes the values of being a sports athlete. Track and Field is
a Co-Curricular Activity that seeks to strengthen character and provide
a holistic education. We aim to build a culture of sporting excellence
and appreciation. Through various drills and exercises, we develop the
athletes’ locomotor skills, sense of balance, agility, strength and speed
which will enhance their overall performance. Pupils who show potential
are provided with additional training to harness their talent so as to
be able to represent the school at Track and Field Meets. We also hope
to promote team camaraderie and social cohesion among the team through
relay events.</p>
