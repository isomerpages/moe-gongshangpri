### **Track and Field**

Gongshang Gladiators has a history of excellence in the National Track and Field meets. Over the years, we have groomed and produced numerous athletes who went on to compete in the international arena. Under the guidance of our teachers and coaches, we have been able to nurture and inculcate in our athletes the values of being a sports athlete.
Track and Field is a Co-Curricular Activity that seeks to strengthen character and provide a holistic education. We aim to build a culture of sporting excellence and appreciation. Through various drills and exercises, we develop the athletes’ locomotor skills, sense of balance, agility, strength and speed which will enhance their overall performance.
Pupils who show potential are provided with additional training to harness their talent so as to be able to represent the school at Track and Field Meets. We also hope to promote team camaraderie and social cohesion among the team through relay events.

**Objectives of CCA:** 
* To develop appreciation and a sustainable interest in track &amp; field as a sport
*  develop foundational techniques and skills to enhance the athlete’s ability to run, jump and throw
* To learn the values of fair play and to conduct ourselves in accordance with our school values
