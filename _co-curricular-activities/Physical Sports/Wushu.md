<br>In Gongshang Primary School, we believe in fostering a holistic development,
and our Wushu CCA is a testament to our commitment to nurturing not only
the minds but also the bodies and spirits of our students. Our Wushu CCA
is designed to empower our students through the practice of discipline,
focus, and physical fitness. Students will learn a variety of traditional
Wushu forms, which not only enhance their physical prowess but also instill
a sense of mental fortitude. Our experienced and dedicated instructors
bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to guide our students in their
Wushu journey. From basic stances to advanced techniques, our instructors
ensure a supportive and challenging environment for all skill levels. Over
the years, our Wushu team has had a proud history of accomplishments at
the National School Games (NSG). This year, as we gear up for the NSG Presentation
2024, our CCA is committed to showcasing our skills and dedication on the
national stage. Besides showcasing their talents at competitions, there
are opportunities created for our students to also dazzle the audience
with breathtaking performances during school events. With continued support
from all of us. our students will have a memorable and successful experience,
fostering a spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship.</p>
