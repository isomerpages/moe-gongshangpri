<h3><strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Programme</strong></h3>
<p>The CCA Programme forms an integral part in the holistic education of
all Gongshangers. We strongly believe in providing an all-round education
for every child to discover their interests and maximize his optimal potential.
In addition, the CCA programme provides opportunities for students to exhibit
our school values and to live up to the school vision of “Active Learner,
Confident Learners, Gracious Citizens.”&nbsp; It is also a platform for
students to develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school and
for friendships to be forged and characters to be moulded.</p>
<p>The CCA Programme aims to:</p>
<p>1. Develop in students knowledge, skills, values and attitudes related
to their chosen CCA.</p>
<p>2. Foster and develop qualities of self-discipline, team spirit, leadership
and group loyalty.</p>
<p>3. Inculcate in students core values, social and emotional competencies
and the emerging 21st century competencies.</p>
<p>4. Help students to develop a passion for a particular activity, be it
a sport or a musical pursuit, which they can continue to pursue in their
adulthood.</p>
<p>The CCA programme in Gongshang Primary School is conducted after curriculum
hours for students from Primary 3 to Primary 6.&nbsp; Most CCAs are on
Wednesday afternoons. For students who are representing the school in their
various areas, Monday afternoon is another day set aside for their extra
training or practice to hone their skills or knowledge. Basketball CCA
takes place on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.</p>
<p>To cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students, the school
provides a spectrum of activities which can be broadly categorized into
4 groups, namely: Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Uniformed
Group and Clubs and Societies.</p>
