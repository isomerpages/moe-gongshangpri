<p>Participation in CCA</p>
<p>Participation in CCA is not compulsory in Primary School, though strongly
encouraged. For a pupil to have a CCA status reflected in his/her CCA records,
a minimum of 70% of attendance is required.</p>
<p>How are CCAs allocated to pupils?</p>
<p>In allocating CCA to pupils, the school will consider available vacancies
which are tied to manpower and logistical constraints. However, the school
remains committed to ensuring that pupils will be given ONE of their three
choices to support their interest.</p>
<p>Where there is an overwhelming number of applicants for a CCA, teachers’
assessment of pupils’ aptitude and attitude will be taken into consideration.
Teachers’ feedback includes those from Form Teachers and Subject Teachers.
Where profiles of pupils are similar yet constrained by vacancies, the
final decision will be made by the HOD (PE/CCA/Aesthetics).</p>
