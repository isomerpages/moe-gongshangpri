<h3><strong>Discipline Philosophy</strong></h3>
<p>Gongshang Primary believes in disciplining with care. We seek to guide
every student to grow into a <strong>self-disciplined </strong>individual
who demonstrates Perseverance, Thrift, Integrity and Respect for themselves,
others and the environment.</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, Gongshang Primary believes that every student
in school bears the responsibility to create a safe and conducive environment
where everyone can play, learn and grow positively.</p>
<p>To foster a caring and conducive school environment, our school rules
reflect the conduct expected of every Gongshang student at all times -
both within and outside of school. When a student demonstrates misbehaviour,
support and guidance will be given by the school to help him / her to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Reflect on the impact of his / her actions,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Understand the need to abide by school rules and regulations, and the
consequences for not doing so,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume responsibility and accountability for his / her misconduct,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propose solutions/resolutions for reconciliation and self-improvement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;For recalcitrant or serious cases, students may receive a ‘Fair’
or ‘Poor’ for their conduct grade, which will affect their eligibility
for any school or national award (e.g. scholarships, CCA or Edusave awards)
for the academic year.</p>
