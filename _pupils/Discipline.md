<h3><strong>Discipline</strong></h3>
<p>The Philosophy of Gongshang’s Discipline is “Discipline with Care”.&nbsp;
Every child and adult in the school has the right to a safe and conducive
environment for learning and teaching.&nbsp; Thus, everyone in the school
has the responsibility to ensure the safety of themselves and others by
behaving in a reasonable manner.</p>
<p>The eventual goal of Discipline is Self-Discipline, which is anchored
on the school’s core values of Respect, Integrity, Perseverance and Thrift
as well as the core values of Responsibility, Resilience, Care and Harmony.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this, the school rules state the conduct expected
of Gongshang pupils. When a pupil misbehaves inside or outside school,
appropriate corrective actions will be taken to help him/her to improve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In line with the educational goal of character building, one of the corrective
actions is the award of “FAIR” for Conduct grade.&nbsp; A pupil awarded
a “FAIR” grade will NOT be eligible for any School or National Award, including
Academic, CCA, or Edusave Awards for that year.</p>
<p>Teachers, pupils and their parents are encouraged to be familiar with
the school rules and the appropriate behaviour expected of every Gongshang
Primary School pupil so that we can work together to grow the Gongshanger
into a gracious person with character.</p>
