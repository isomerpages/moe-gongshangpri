<h3><strong>Peer Support Leaders</strong></h3>
<p>In 2020, Gongshang Primary School implemented the Peer Support and Relationships
(PSR) programme with the intent to build a positive and caring culture
among the pupils. Driven by the strong belief that a caring and well-supported
community yields better academic learning and promotes mental wellness,
all pupils will be equipped with the basic peer bonding, peer helping and
peer influencing skills to help their peers. They will also partake in
cyber wellness activities that the school organizes for them.</p>
<p>To level up the pupilsâ€™ capacity, the school appoints a group of Peer
Support Leaders (PSLs) who undergo training for more complex roles, like
looking out for peers who exhibit signs of distress or have problems befriending
others. The PSLs play a vital role in the school as they form the additional
social network support for their peers.</p>
