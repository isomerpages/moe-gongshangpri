<h2>Applying for a CCA</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Participation in CCAs</strong>
</p>
<p>Participation in CCAs is not compulsory in Primary School, though strongly
encouraged. For a pupil to have a CCA status reflected in his/her CCA records,
a minimum of <strong><u>70%</u></strong> of attendance is required.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Allocation</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that pupils will be given ONE of their three
choices to support their interest. We seek parents' understanding that
allocation a function of student vacancies vis-a-vis the availability of
school resources.</p>
<p>Where there is an overwhelming number of applicants for a CCA, a ballot
will be held by the HOD (PE/CCA/Aesthetics).

<h3>Appeal for an alternative CCA</h3>
<p>Honouring a commitment is part of character building and provides a fair
time for a pupil to learn about the CCA experientially.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Appeal Period: 1 Sep - 31 Oct</strong>
</p>
<p>Appeals are NOT based on a first-come-first-serve basis. Appeals will
be consolidated and processed in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The outcome of any appeal will be subject to available vacancies.
Should there be no vacancy, the pupil will be placed on the wait-list until
15 Jan in the following year to allow for further movement in and out of
school.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Unsuccessful appeals will not be brought forward. A fresh appeal
has to be made in Oct for the following year.<u>&nbsp;Appeals outside the window period will not be processed.</u>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Vacancies are tied to safety guidelines to provide a conducive environment
for our students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students who need to change CCA due to a&nbsp;<strong>medical condition</strong>,
kindly write in to the HOD of (PE/CCA/Aesthetics) directly at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:mehrun_nisha@schools.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">mehrun_nisha@schools.gov.sg</a>.
Medical conditions will need to be substantiated with supporting documents
by a doctor and the case will be reviewed. The new CCA allocation will
depend on CCAs that have available vacancies.</p>
