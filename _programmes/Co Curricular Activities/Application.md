<h2>Applying for a CCA</h2>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Participation in CCAs</strong>
</p>
<p>Participation in CCAs is not compulsory in Primary School, though strongly
encouraged. For a pupil to have a CCA status reflected in his/her CCA records,
a minimum of <strong><u>70%</u></strong> of attendance is required.</p>
<p><strong>CCA Allocation</strong>
</p>
<p>We are committed to ensuring that pupils will be given ONE of their three
choices to support their interest. We seek parents' understanding that
allocation a function of student vacancies vis-a-vis the availability of
school resources.</p>
<p>Where there is an overwhelming number of applicants for a CCA, a ballot
will be held by the HOD (PE/CCA/Aesthetics).</p>

<h3>Appeal for an alternative CCA</h3>
<p>Pupils must remain in their assigned CCA for at least 1 Semester before
appealing. Honouring a commitment is part of character building and provides
a fair time for a pupil to learn about the CCA experientially.</p>
<p>The outcome of any appeal will be subject to available vacancies. Should
there be no vacancy, the pupil will be placed on the wait-list.</p>
