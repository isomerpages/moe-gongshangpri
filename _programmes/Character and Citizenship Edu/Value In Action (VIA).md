### **Values in Action (VIA)**
Values in Action (VIA) in Gongshang aims to nurture our pupils to become socially responsible citizens and to help them understand that every citizen has a role in enhancing the well-being of the community.

VIA experiences are also closely linked to the CCE domains which vary from self to community as this spiral approach will allow pupils to progress at their own pace and there will be better coherence with regards to all the experiences that they are receiving.
