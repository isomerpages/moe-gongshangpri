<h2>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The ECHA is introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2012 to enable
schools to recognise pupils who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions.</p>
<p>The award also supports schools’ continuing efforts in nurturing pupils
of good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned
citizens.</p>
<p>ECHA aims to recognise pupils for demonstrating exemplary values and civic
responsibility through their behaviour and actions. This is aligned with
MOE’s emphasis on Values, Character and Citizenship Education.</p>

criteria as stipulated in both the Basic Tier and the 2nd Tier:</p>
