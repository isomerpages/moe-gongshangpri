<h3><strong>Values in Action (VIA)</strong></h3>
<p>Values in Action (VIA) in Gongshang aims to nurture our pupils to become
socially responsible citizens and to help them understand that every citizen
has a role in enhancing the well-being of the community.</p>
<p>VIA experiences are also closely linked to the CCE domains which vary
from self to community as this spiral approach will allow pupils to progress
at their own pace and there will be better coherence with regards to all
the experiences that they are receiving.</p>
