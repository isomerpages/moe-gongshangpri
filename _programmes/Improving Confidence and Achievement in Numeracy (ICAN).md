### **Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**


Our school embarked on the ICAN (Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy)&nbsp;journey in 2017. Different groups of pupils experienced this pedagogical approach. A few of&nbsp;  
our teachers have undergone and are undergoing training sessions on its implementation&nbsp;process for various topics such as Whole Numbers, Fractions and Word Problems.&nbsp;Besides implementing what they have learnt in class, the teachers also conduct sharing&nbsp;sessions with the other Mathematics teachers.

ICAN emphasises the importance of concrete learning to enable pupils to make better sense of&nbsp;their learning. Pupils have lots of fun in their mathematics learning as they gain confidence&nbsp;and motivation in learning the subject.
