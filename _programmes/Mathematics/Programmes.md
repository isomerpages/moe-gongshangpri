#### **Learning Approach**
**Learning Experiences through Activity-Based Lesson (ABL)**<br>
Activity-based lessons in the classroom allow students to justify their thinking, to reason, and to argue their points of view. Students become active builders of knowledge rather than passive recipients of information.

**Customised Approaches to Support Diverse Learning Needs**<br>
For lower-primary students who do not have the necessary foundation in numeracy skills when they enter primary school, they will be identified for the&nbsp;&nbsp;**Learning Support for Mathematics Programme (LSM)**&nbsp;&nbsp;.The LSM is an early intervention effort aimed at providing support to students who need extra help in learning the subject.

For the middle primary levels, the&nbsp;&nbsp;**Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)**&nbsp;&nbsp;programme supports low progress learners students using intervention strategies and models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues of learning gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure – Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.

In line with the school’s continual emphasis on enriching and developing students’ potential to their fullest, identified students who demonstrate interest and ability in Mathematics are placed in enrichment programmes&nbsp; (Problem Solving Module, E2K and Math Olympiad competitions) to develop good thinking habits in their approach to problem solving.

**SEAL Approach in Problem Solving**<br>
The use of the SEAL approach in problem solving enabled students to systematically search for clues in word problems and to apply the appropriate strategies to solve them.

**S-**&nbsp;Search for clues<br>
**E-**&nbsp;Explore what strategies to use<br>
**A-** Act out the plan<br>
**L-** Look Back

**Learning Through Games**<br>
Through the use of games, we strive to nurture students’ creative and inventive thinking. Games provide the opportunity for students to apply their reasoning in a fun and inviting environment, where learning through engagement is promoted.
