<h3><strong>Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To develop every pupil into a critical thinker, active learner, reliable
contributor and confident communicator through problem solving.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Approach</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Learning Experiences through Activity-Based Lesson (ABL)</strong>
<br>Activity-based lessons in the classroom allow students to justify their
thinking, to reason, and to argue their points of view. Students become
active builders of knowledge rather than passive recipients of information.</p>
<p><strong>Customised Approaches to Support Diverse Learning Needs</strong>
<br>For lower-primary students who do not have the necessary foundation in
numeracy skills when they enter primary school, they will be identified
for the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Learning Support for Mathematics Programme (LSM)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;.The
LSM is an early intervention effort aimed at providing support to students
who need extra help in learning the subject.</p>
<p>For the middle primary levels, the&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Improving Confidence and Achievement in Numeracy (ICAN)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;programme
supports low progress learners students using intervention strategies and
models that are guided by research to tackle the 4 key issues of learning
gaps, language, motivation and memory. The lessons follow the FREMC structure
– Factual Fluency, Readiness, Engagement, Mastery and Consolidation.</p>
<p>In line with the school’s continual emphasis on enriching and developing
students’ potential to their fullest, identified students who demonstrate
interest and ability in Mathematics are placed in enrichment programmes&nbsp;
(Problem Solving Module, E2K and Math Olympiad competitions) to develop
good thinking habits in their approach to problem solving.</p>
<p><strong>SEAL Approach in Problem Solving</strong>
<br>The use of the SEAL approach in problem solving enabled students to systematically
search for clues in word problems and to apply the appropriate strategies
to solve them.</p>
<p><strong>S-</strong>&nbsp;Search for clues
<br><strong>E-</strong>&nbsp;Explore what strategies to use
<br><strong>A-</strong> Act out the plan
<br><strong>L-</strong> Look Back</p>
<p><strong>Learning Through Games</strong>
<br>Through the use of games, we strive to nurture students’ creative and
inventive thinking. Games provide the opportunity for students to apply
their reasoning in a fun and inviting environment, where learning through
engagement is promoted.</p>
