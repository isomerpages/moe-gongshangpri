### **Learning for Life Programme (LLP)**

**Objectives** <br>
The focus of the **S**ports **O**pportunities and **A**chievement p**R**ogramme (SOAR) is centered around providing comprehensive sporting learning opportunities and enriching experiences for all students. The core objective of this programme is to offer a well-rounded approach to sports development, which encompasses not only the enhancement of specific skills but also emphasizes personal growth, character development and sustained engagement in sports activities. Beyond honing physical abilities, participants are guided in developing qualities like discipline, teamwork, resilience, and leadership. These attributes not only enhance their performance on the playing field but also serve as valuable assets in all aspects of life.

The primary intention at Tier 1, which emphasizes broad-based development, is to introduce students to a holistic range of sports offerings available within the school's PE and PAL programmes. These programmes provide students with the chance to explore a diverse array of sports, enabling them to acquire new skills and values related to sportsmanship and teamwork. These experiences are woven into the regular curriculum hours, ensuring accessibility to all students.

At the Tier 2 level, known as the Sports Excellence tier, the programme's focus shifts towards the identification and nurturing of students displaying remarkable potential and talents in sports. Our aim is to cultivate these talents with the ultimate goal of achieving excellence. Through a careful selection process, students who demonstrate a natural aptitude for a particular sport are identified and recognized. These students become integral members of the school team in key CCAs including Track &amp; Field, Wushu, Basketball, Badminton, and Floorball.
SOAR is dedicated to providing a multifaceted approach to sports education, ensuring that every student has the chance to engage, learn, and grow through sports. From broad exposure to a variety of sports to specialized training for those with exceptional potential, SOAR is committed to nurturing a culture of sportsmanship, skill development, and personal accomplishment among students.

**Approach (The 3 E approach) for SOAR**
<br>
**Exposure:** The foundation of our approach lies in providing comprehensive exposure to all individuals. This commences with a broad-based development curriculum within the Physical Education (PE) programme. This foundational experience lays the groundwork for a lifelong engagement with recreational sports, ensuring that the skills and knowledge acquired continue to serve individuals well beyond their academic years. <br>
**Engagement:** As individuals progress, they foster a deeper connection to sports through active participation in Co-Curricular Activities (CCA). This involvement is a pivotal step toward refining and expanding skills. Moving from fundamental to intermediate levels of proficiency, students gain a profound understanding of their chosen activities, translating to a holistic and enriched sports experience.<br>
**Enthuse:** The programme is geared towards those who demonstrate remarkable excellence in their respective sports. It is a platform for students with a keen interest and exceptional ability to explore diverse sporting avenues, fostering both excellence and exploration. This initiative encapsulates our commitment not only to nurturing excellence but also inspiring a lifelong love for sports and a broader exploration of sports possibilities. 

Together, these 3 Es work in synergy to create a comprehensive and sporting learning opportunity within SOAR.
