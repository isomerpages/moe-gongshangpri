<p>PAL is an initiative by MOE to provide all Primary 1 &amp; 2 students
with a well-rounded primary school experience. PAL encourages learning
beyond the classroom and gives students opportunities to discover new interests,
learn new skills and develop their character. In PAL, students will be
exposed to Sports and Outdoor Education, Performing and Visual Arts. As
a Phase 8 school, PAL was officially launched in Gongshang in 2017.</p>
