<h3><strong>Our Signature Programmes</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Games Day</strong>
</p>
<p>All P1 to P6 students participated in Games Day, applying PE lesson skills
through inter-house competitions (P3-P6) and inter-class competitions (P1-P2).
This culminating event provided an authentic sporting context where students
demonstrated technical skills, game strategies and sporting values in a
celebratory environment<strong>.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Learning for Life Programme – SOAR (Sports Opportunities and Achievement pRogramme)&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Multi-Sport Exposure: Wushu, Basketball, Badminton, and Target Sports</strong>
</p>
<p>All<strong> </strong>P1 and P2 students participated in hands-on introductions
to Wushu, Basketball, and Badminton, gaining fundamental skills and developing
appreciation for each sport. In Wushu, they practised basic stances and
hand forms to build balance and coordination; in Basketball, they focused
on dribbling and hand-eye coordination; and in Badminton, they learned
proper racket grips and underarm serves for consistency and control.</p>
<p>P3 students explored target sports such as bowling, archery and shooting,
developing precision, focus, and perseverance. They practised proper techniques,
stances, and controlled breathing, which helped enhance accuracy and confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sports Psychology Workshops</strong>
</p>
<p>Sports CCA students take part in Sports Psychology Workshops that equip
them with mental skills such as resilience, focus, and emotional control,
supporting their growth as confident, well-rounded athletes both on and
off the field.</p>
<p><strong>Sports CCA Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>Students also engage in exciting Sports CCA experiences, from rock climbing
to attending international events such as FIBA competitions. These opportunities
help them gain exposure to professional-level sports, build confidence,
and develop a greater passion and understanding of their chosen disciplines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Fruttie-Veggie Bites Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to make healthy choices by consuming fruits and
vegetables as daily snacks. To motivate participation, students collect
stamps from their teachers each time they make a healthy choice, which
can later be redeemed for a reward. This programme not only promotes good
eating habits but also instills the importance of personal responsibility
for one’s health in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>H2 Challenge Tasks</strong>
</p>
<p>The H2 Challenge Tasks are designed to inspire students to maintain a
healthy and active lifestyle while developing creativity and self-directed
learning skills. Beyond individual growth, these activities encourage students
to involve their family members, fostering stronger family bonds and creating
opportunities for shared experiences centered around health, wellness,
and fun. By combining personal development with family engagement, the
programme promotes holistic well-being for both students and their families.</p>
<p><strong>Unstructurd Recess Play</strong>
</p>
<p>During Unstructured Recess Play, each class is provided with a set of
PE equipment, which they share with their peers to encourage cooperative
play. Students have the freedom to explore different games and activities,
learning to take turns, negotiate rules, and collaborate with others. This
unstructured playtime not only promotes physical activity and skill development
but also helps students build social skills, teamwork, and positive relationships
in a fun and engaging environment.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;P3 Swimsafer Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The P3 SwimSafer Programme is designed to equip students with essential
water safety and swimming skills, targeting those who are new to swimming.
Beyond learning how to swim, students develop important life skills such
as independence, responsibility, and self-care, including taking care of
their belongings and managing themselves confidently in a swimming environment.
The programme fosters a sense of personal responsibility and resilience,
ensuring students gain both the practical skills and the confidence to
participate safely in water-based activities.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;P4 Neighbourhood Walk</strong>
</p>
<p>During the P4 Neighbourhood Walk, students embark on a trip to Tampines
Eco Green Park, applying what they have learned about planning and preparing
for an outdoor day trip. They practise packing appropriately for a day
outdoors and taking necessary measures for personal safety and protection.
While at the park, students explore and appreciate the natural environment,
including its flora and fauna, and learn to demonstrate socially responsible
behaviour, such as respecting the park and fellow visitors. This hands-on
experience fosters environmental awareness, independence, and a sense of
stewardship for nature.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;P5 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp is a 3-day, 2-night experience
designed to help students embrace nature while developing independence,
resilience, and a sense of place. Through engaging activities aligned with
the Outdoor Education in Physical Education (OE in PE) curriculum, students
apply and reinforce outdoor living skills, becoming comfortable and confident
in natural environments.</p>
<p>During the camp, students explore and form meaningful connections with
the places they visit, fostering curiosity, appreciation, and a sense of
stewardship for the environment and its inhabitants. They also practise
a safety mindset, making responsible decisions that ensure their own well-being
and that of others, enabling them to fully enjoy and benefit from all outdoor
experiences. The camp provides a holistic platform for students to integrate
knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes while cultivating both personal
growth and environmental awareness.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;P6 Inter-class Games</strong>
</p>
<p>The P6 Inter-Class Games provide students with an authentic platform to
showcase the skills and knowledge they have developed throughout the year.
Beyond competing in sports, students also take on roles in sports education,
learning how to manage timekeeping, keep scores, and umpire games. This
hands-on experience not only reinforces their understanding of the rules
and strategies of various sports but also develops leadership, responsibility,
and teamwork, giving them a well-rounded perspective on both playing and
managing sporting activities.</p>
