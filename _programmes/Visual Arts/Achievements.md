### **Achievements**
#### **Draw My Stamp Story Art Competition 2020:**
This nationwide art competition organised by The Singapore Philatelic Museum served as a platform for students to challenge their creativity on designing a background that complements the stamps. Our students did us proud by achieving 3 Awards in the Primary Category (10-12 years), demonstrating their out-of-the-box thinking and aesthetic abilities that they have learnt in our Art Curriculum.
