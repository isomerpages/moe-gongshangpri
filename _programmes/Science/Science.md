<h3><strong>Science</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>Every pupil is imbued with a sense of curiosity and inquiry, equipped
with skills and competencies as active learner and critical thinkers to
contribute in the 21st century.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>1) Every Child a Seed</p>
<p>We seek to share with your child that Singapore’s greenery is a result
of every Singaporean’s dedicated effort and that they too, can play a part
in maintaining our City in a Garden. Each Primary 3 pupil will receive
a plant starter kit comprising a Plant Journal, a pot, seeds and potting
mix. The Plant Journal contains simple instructions to teach the pupils
how to grow and care for their plants. It also has simple activity sheets
which the pupils can do. They can also share their plant stories with their
classmates.</p>
