### **MTL Fortnight**
#### **MTL Fortnight, Racial Harmony Day (RHD) and Healthy Lifestyle Fiesta**
The MTL Department, CCE Departments and Holistic Health Committee had collaborated to&nbsp;celebrate the above event.&nbsp; The focus theme for the year is to&nbsp;learn about cultural performances.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This event provides a platform for our pupils to learn to respect the cultural and religious diversity in Singapore as well as learn the importance of harmonious living among different races and cultures.&nbsp; The Mother Tongue Language Fortnight activities allow the pupils to actively learn Mother Tongue Language and learn about their cultural roots through the various enriching and engaging activities.&nbsp; Pupils experience the culture through performances, displays and exhibits of the different races as well as taking part in games, quizzes, trishaw rides and having fun at the photo booth. To cultivate a lifelong habit of active and healthy living from young, a plethora of interesting activities has also been lined up for the pupils.&nbsp; The school also invited pupils from Poi Ching School to have a joint commemoration for RHD.
