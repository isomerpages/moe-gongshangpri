<p>The Ministry of Education is equipping our students with Centrally Provisioned
Digital tools (“Digital Tools”) to further support their learning experience
and educational journey. These Digital Tools complement teaching and learning
for your child/ward, enabling collaboration, productivity and communication.
These Digital Tools include:</p>

use of these applications for the purpose of providing the required services
and ensuring the tools function accordingly. The collection, use and disclosure
of such data are governed by the commercial provider’s terms of use, which
