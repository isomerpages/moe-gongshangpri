<h3><strong>Responsible Use Policy (RUP) </strong><br><strong>for Computing Devices</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Gongshang pupils,</p>
<p>We use computing devices such as laptops and iPads in our school to help
us learn better. These devices allow us to access the Internet, where we
can find useful information and even communicate with others. To ensure
everyone in Gongshang enjoys learning and learns in a safe environment,
please obey the following rules while using computing devices in school
and at home.</p>
<h4><strong>Taking Care of Myself</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I will use computing devices and the Internet to help me learn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will inform my teachers or parents immediately if I encounter unkind
behaviour or if I feel uncomfortable when using a computing device.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will only play games during lessons when my teacher allows me to play
those games to help with my learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will only access the Internet during lessons when my teacher allow me
to and guide me, to help me with my learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will be careful when searching for information on the Internet, and
look for information that is correct and true. I know that some websites
may not have information that is accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will not share my home address, email particulars, phone number, account
usernames and passwords, or share photos of myself or my friends, with
others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Being Kind to Others</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I will respect the work of others and will not use their music, videos,
photographs, posts or comments without their permission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If someone is unkind online, I will inform my teacher or parents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will use polite words and avoid upsetting others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will be helpful and kind when I give comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before I post something online, I will THINK: Is it True? Helpful? Inspiring?
Necessary? Kind?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will not take or share photographs or videos of others without asking
them for permission first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Cherishing Devices</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>I will ask for a teacher’s permission before I download any apps or media
(e.g. photographs, videos or music) during lessons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will keep snacks and drinks away from the computing devices I use, to
avoid damaging them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will be careful with the computing devices that belong to the school.
I am aware that if I damage or misplace them, I may have to pay for them
to be repaired or replaced.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that I need to be responsible when using the school's computing
devices. I know that I am not the only pupil using the school’s devices
because they are shared amongst all pupils of Gongshang. This way, we can
all learn better, together. If I do not obey these rules, I understand
I will have to face the consequences according to the school’s rules and
regulations, which may include not being able to use these computing devices
for a period of time.</p>
