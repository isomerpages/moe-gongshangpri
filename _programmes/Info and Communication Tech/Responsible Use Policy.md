<h3><strong>Responsible Use Policy for use of EdTech Resources</strong></h3>
<p>Dear Gongshang students,</p>
<p>Educational Technology (EdTech) helps us learn, play, create and connect
in many ways. Examples of EdTech include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning devices (such as tablets and laptops)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online accounts (such as Student Learning Space “SLS” and MOE Identity
Management System “MIMS”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School internet networks</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to use EdTech safely, kindly and responsibly so that all of us
can learn well and stay safe online. Read on to find out how we can do
so.</p>

<p>Handle devices carefully and report any damage or loss to your teacher.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you damage or lose a device, you may have to pay for repair or replacement.</p>

<p><strong><em>School devices are shared across fellow students. When a school device is damaged, another student may not to get to use it for learning.</em></strong>
