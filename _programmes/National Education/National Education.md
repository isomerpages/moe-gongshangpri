### **National Education**

National Education was initiated in 1996 by the Ministry of Education to foster national cohesion and instill a sense of national identity among students and younger Singaporeans.  
  
National Education aims to inculcate an understanding of the challenges and vulnerabilities that are unique to Singapore. It seeks to nurture rooted and resilient citizens who are ready to take on future global challenges and possess strong civic consciousness in taking an active role in enhancing the lives of others around them. 

  
National Education comprises four core annual events:

*   Total Defence Day
*   International Friendship Day
*   Racial Harmony Day
*   National Day
