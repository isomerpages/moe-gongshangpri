<p>Social Studies aims to instill in students a stronger appreciation of
the values that shape Singaporean society, fostering attitudes that encourage
care for both their community and the broader world. It seeks to cultivate
empathy in their interactions with others.</p>
<p>The Curriculum therefore envisions Social Studies students as informed,
concerned and participative citizens, competent in decision-making and
driven by a genuine commitment to contribute responsibly to society and
the global community.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A thematic approach is adopted to frame the Social Studies Primary <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/-/media/files/primary/2020-social-studies-primary.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">syllabus</a> and
is organized into three broad clusters, with each level of study guided
by an inquiry focus.</p>
