individuals.</p>

<p>In conjunction with Children’s Day on 3 October 2025, Gongshang Primary
School has accepted the invitation to once again be part of the Children’s
Day Appeal (CDA) 2025, organised by Community Chest as part of the school’s
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR).</p>
<p>As Singapore celebrates 60 years of progress, we look forward to a future
where every dream can take flight. In this milestone year, the Children’s
Day Appeal (CDA) 2025 continues to nurture caring and sharing, encouraging
children to embrace the spirit of giving and grow into compassionate, community-minded
individuals.</p>
<p>Aligned with the Ministry of Education’s Values-in-Action Programme, this
initiative nurtures a heart for those who need it most. <strong>100%</strong> of
funds raised through CDA go towards empowering the lives of adults with
disabilities, children with special needs and youth-at-risk, families in
need of assistance, persons with mental health conditions and seniors in
need of support.</p>
<p>To mark SG60, every donation to CDA 2025 will be <strong>matched dollar-for-dollar</strong> by
the Government under the SG60 General Matching Grant, doubling the impact
of each act of kindness.</p>
<p>We warmly invite you to support your child’s giving journey. Simply scan
the PayNow QR code below to contribute — together, your family’s support
will uplift lives and inspire young hearts to lead with kindness and embrace
inclusivity.</p>

<p>As we celebrate SG60 with CDA, let’s remember how far we have come and
how much more we can achieve together. May every small act of giving help
a million dreams take flight.</p>
<p>Together, let’s build a caring and inclusive Singapore where every dream
matters.</p>
<p>We would like you to encourage your child to make their own donation and
you can join by matching the amount that he/she donates. You may scan the
customized PayNow QR Code and this PayNow QR Code will remain valid until
31 December 2025. You can also go to the school website for more information.</p>
