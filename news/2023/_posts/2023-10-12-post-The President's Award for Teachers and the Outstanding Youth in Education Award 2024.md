#### **THE PRESIDENT'S AWARD FOR TEACHERS (PAT) AND THE OUTSTANDING YOUTH IN EDUCATION AWARD (OYEA) 2024**

PAT recognises experienced educators for their role in moulding the future of our nation. These teachers are role models for the teaching profession, as they demonstrate a deep passion for teaching, and inspire both their students and peers through their words and deeds.
OYEA recognises and honours the achievements of young educators who have shown admirable passion for teaching, and commitment to inspiring and nurturing their students. Launched in 1999, it seeks to recognise excellent younger teachers for their youthful idealism, enthusiasm, energy, and serving as inspiring role models for the fraternity. Hence, OYEA 2024 is open to educators who were **born on or after 30 June 1989.**
  
The nomination period for PAT 2024 and OYEA 2024 **opens on Thursday, 12 October 2023, and will close on Wednesday, 10 January 2024.** We strongly encourage you to nominate deserving teachers for these awards in recognition of their good work.
