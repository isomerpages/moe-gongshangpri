<p>In 2024, we commemorate the 40<sup>th</sup> milestone of the Children’s
Day Appeal (CDA), symbolising four decades of its meaningful impact. Since
its inception in 1984, the Children’s Day Appeal has stood as an annual
beacon for fundraising efforts, advocating for children’s involvement,
and rallying substantial support for communities-in-need.</p>
<p>Aligned with the Ministry of Education’s Values-in-Action Programme, this
campaign encourages preschoolers and primary school students to embrace
the spirit of giving, fostering essential values of compassion, respect,
and empathy from an early age. <strong>100%</strong> of funds raised through
Children’s Day Appeal go towards empowering the lives of adults with disabilities,
children with special needs and youth-at-risk, families in need of assistance,
persons with mental health conditions and seniors in need of support.</p>
