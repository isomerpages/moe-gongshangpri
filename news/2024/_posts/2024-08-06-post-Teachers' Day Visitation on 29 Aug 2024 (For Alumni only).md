<p>Dear Gongshang Alumni,</p>
<p>Please register using the link below if you wish to visit your teachers
on 29 August 2024. (Closing date for registration: 28 Aug 2024, 6pm)</p>
<p><a href="https://form.gov.sg/66b1ba1de497608f90a4d22d" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://form.gov.sg/66b1ba1de497608f90a4d22d</a>
</p>
<p>Points to note:</p>
<p>1) You need to verify your identity at the security guard post before
making your way to the school canteen.</p>
<p>2) Visitation is <strong>strictly by appointment only</strong>. (We seek
your understanding to leave the school premises by 12.00pm, as there will
be a staff event afterwards.)</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
