<p>Dear Ex. Gongshangers,</p>
<p>Please register using the link below if you wish to come back to Gongshang
Primary School to visit your teachers on 29 August 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://form.gov.sg/66ac8de0e497608f9020209c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://form.gov.sg/66ac8de0e497608f9020209c</a>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Points to note:</strong>
</p>
<p>1) You need to verify your identity at the security guard post before
entry to the school.</p>
<p>2) You are only allowed to meet your teachers at the canteen area.</p>
<p>3) Visitation time is strictly from 10.45am to 12.00pm. (We seek your
understanding to leave the school premises by 12.00pm, as there will be
a staff event afterwards.)</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
