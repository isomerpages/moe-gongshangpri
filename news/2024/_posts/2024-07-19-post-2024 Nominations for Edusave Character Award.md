<h2>Edusave Character Award (ECHA)</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The ECHA is introduced by Ministry of Education in 2012 to enable schools
to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding
personal qualities through their behaviour and actions. &nbsp;This is part
of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore in order
to broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded.</p>
<p>The award also supports our continuing efforts in nurturing students of
good values and character, who are active contributors and concerned citizens.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>
