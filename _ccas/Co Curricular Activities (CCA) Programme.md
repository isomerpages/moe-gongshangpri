<h3><strong>Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)</strong></h3>
<p>CCAs forms an integral part in the holistic education of all Gongshangers.
We strongly believe in providing an all-round education for every child
to discover their interests and maximize his optimal potential. In addition,
the CCA programme provides opportunities for students to exhibit our school
values and to live up to the school vision of “Active Learner, Confident
Learners, Gracious Citizens.”&nbsp; It is also a platform for students
to develop a sense of identity and belonging to the school and for friendships
to be forged and characters to be moulded.</p>
<p>The CCA Programme aims to:</p>

<p>Develop in students knowledge, skills, values and attitudes related to
their chosen CCA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Foster and develop qualities of self-discipline, team spirit, leadership
and group loyalty.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inculcate in students core values, social and emotional competencies and
the emerging 21st century competencies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help students to develop a passion for a particular activity, be it a
sport or a musical pursuit, which they can continue to pursue in their
adulthood.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To cater to the diverse interests and needs of our students, the school
provides a spectrum of activities which can be broadly categorized into
