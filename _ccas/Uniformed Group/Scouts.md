<p><strong>Objectives of CCA:</strong>
</p>
<p>Cub Scouts (Cubs) is for boys and girls aged 7 – 12 years old.</p>
<p>1. The objective of the Cub Scout programme is to develop the child in
an environment that is intellectually and physically stimulating as well
as providing challenges for the child to face and overcome.</p>
<p>A Cub Scout Group (also known as a Cub Pack) gathers weekly or fortnightly
and is divided into groups called Sixes and led by a Sixer. A Sixer is
a Cub of good standing who carries out tasks that have been set by their
Akela (Cub Scout Leader). Cubs learn to manage themselves and take care
of their peers. In doing so, they get hands-on leadership experience.</p>
<p>2. Activities are typically carried out in Sixes. This encourages Cubs
to take ownership of themselves and grow through peer-led learning. Pack
meetings are opportunities for adventures, learning life skills, hikes,
outdoor cooking, camps, games, shelter-building, knotting, craftwork, and
other Scouting skills – all while making new friends.</p>
<p><strong>Games</strong> – Games are part of every pack meeting (CCA session)
&amp; are typically carried out in Sixes. This provide opportunities for
every Cub to contribute &amp; grow together with their Six.</p>
<p><strong>Adventures</strong> – Cubs are not sit-down creatures; they are
active go-getters! They are at an age where they are adventurous &amp;
excitable. They easily pick up new skills &amp; push their own boundaries.
Cub Scout activities build onto these, &amp; one will find that Cubs are
naturally inspired, curious &amp; raring to go!</p>
<p><strong>Community &amp; Environmental Involvement</strong> – Cubs learn
about the environment &amp; regularly participate in meaningful projects
to improve their surroundings. They are helpers in their homes &amp; communities.
The Scout Law &amp; Promise guides them to do their best to be of service
to others.</p>
<p>3. The Cub Scout programme is based on The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling.
Taking inspiration from the story, Cubs are taught to be prepared for difficult
situations and to do so calmly and methodically.</p>
<p>As the 1st line of the Scout Promise reads, “I promise to do my best!”
– so every boy and girl Cub will endeavour to overcome difficulties, setbacks
and challenges, to do their very best in all things and at all times!</p>
