<h3><strong>Speech and Drama</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Lights, Camera, Action!</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Speech and Drama CCA at Gongshang Primary School is a fun, dynamic,
and enriching programme designed to ignite students’<strong> </strong>imagination
and creativity through the performing arts. Through engaging <strong>drama techniques</strong> and <strong>hands-on experiences,</strong> students
learn to <strong>express themselves confidently</strong> while <strong>developing a strong command of the English language.</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Students will have opportunities to <strong>attend at least one professional drama production each year</strong>,
where they can <strong>observe</strong>, <strong>learn from,</strong> and
be <strong>inspired </strong>by practitioners in Singapore’s vibrant drama
scene. In school, members will <strong>work collaboratively</strong> to <strong>plan and perform productions</strong> for
key events such as <strong>English Week</strong> and <strong>Teacher’s Day</strong>,
gaining valuable experience both on and off stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In 2026, a <strong>selected team</strong> from the Speech and Drama
CCA will proudly represent Gongshang Primary School at the <strong>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2026</strong>,
where students will showcase their <strong>creativity, teamwork,</strong> and <strong>performance skills</strong> on
a national platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Through these rich learning experiences, the CCA aims to nurture
students into <strong>confident performers, effective communicators, and articulate users</strong> of
the English language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Highlights of our CCA include:</strong>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Educational Drama Games</strong>
</p>
<p>Interactive activities such as conversational cards, role-play, and debates
help build rapport, confidence, and collaboration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Public Speaking &amp; Performance</strong>
</p>
<p>Students develop stage presence and confidence as they present ideas,
perform characters, and speak clearly before an audience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>ICT in Drama</strong>
</p>
<p>Students use technological tools to enhance performances and creatively
express and share their ideas.</p>
