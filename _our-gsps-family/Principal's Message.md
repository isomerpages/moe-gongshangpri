Dear Students, Parents, and Valued Members of the Gongshang Primary School Community,

Founded in 1920 by Mr Shi Su and originally known as ‘The Chinese Industrial and Commercial Continuation School’, Gongshang Primary School is an institution deeply rooted in history and committed to nurturing ***active learners, confident leaders, and gracious citizens.*** As the 10th Principal of the school, I am honored and privileged to stand at the helm of a legacy that spans generations and continues to shape the lives of young minds.

<u>A Glimpse into our Heritage</u> 

Our school's history is a tapestry woven with threads of dedication, resilience, and unwavering commitment to excellence. Since its establishment in 1920, Gongshang Primary School has stood as a beacon of education in Singapore for over 103 years. Throughout this journey, we have witnessed countless milestones, such as becoming a government school in 1985 and moving to our current campus in Tampines, and the setting up of MOE Kindergarten in 2022 to provide quality education at the pre-school level. Each of these milestones marks a step forward in our mission to provide holistic education to our students.

From its humble beginnings as a night school at Tanjong Pagar Road, Gongshang Primary School has evolved into a vibrant community of learners, educators, and parents who collectively contribute to the rich tapestry of our institution. Our legacy is characterized by academic achievements, artistic endeavors, sporting triumphs, and above all, the nurturing of well-rounded individuals ready to face the challenges of the world.

<u>Forging Active Learners, Confident Leaders, and Gracious Citizens </u>

Our school's Vision of ‘active learners, confident leaders, and gracious citizens' encapsulates our commitment to nurturing students who are not only academically proficient, but also possess the qualities required to succeed in an ever-changing world.

<i>Active Learners</i>: At Gongshang, we believe in cultivating a thirst for knowledge that extends beyond the classroom. Our students are encouraged to be curious, inquisitive, and proactive in their pursuit of learning. By fostering critical thinking, creativity, and a love for lifelong learning, we empower our students to thrive in a knowledge-driven society. Our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Fluent Speakers Future Stars: Developing Gongshangers into Effective Communicators, and Learning for Life Programme (LLP) - S.O.A.R. (Sports Opportunities and Achievement pRogramme) complement our core academic and student development programmes, offering our students more opportunities to pursue learning in line with their interests, while enabling them to develop 21st Century Competencies (21CC). 

<i>Confident Leaders</i>: Leadership is a cornerstone of our educational philosophy. Through a combination of guidance, mentorship, and experiential learning opportunities, we empower our students to discover and develop their leadership potential. Whether it's through student leadership roles (such as prefects, CCA leaders, peer support leaders and class representatives), community service projects (e.g. P5 VIA project and P6 E-bazaar), or academic pursuits, our students graduate with the confidence and skills necessary to make positive contributions to society.

<i>Gracious Citizens</i>: In a globalized world, being a gracious citizen is of paramount importance. We instill in our students a deep sense of rootedness to the country, social responsibility, empathy, and cultural awareness. Through various community engagement initiatives and character education programmes, our students learn the value of compassion, respect, and the significance of giving back to the community. 

<u>A Shared Journey Ahead</u>

With a dedicated team of educators, supportive parents, and motivated students, I am confident that we will continue to uphold the legacy of Gongshang Primary School while embracing innovation and change.

I would like to take this opportunity to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our parents for entrusting us with the education and development of your children. To our dedicated educators, your passion and commitment shape the future of our students. And to our students, remember that you are the embodiment of our school's vision, and we are here to guide and support you every step of the way.

Thank you for being a part of the Gongshang Primary School family. Together, let us script another chapter of success, growth, and impact.


Yours-in-education, <br>
Mrs Soh-Lim Tzyy Shiuan <br>
