### **Fathers@Gongshang**
#### **About Us**
**Fathers@Gongshang** is part of the Singapore's nationwide initiative of 'Dads for Life' Programme, where we encourage all fathers to share a mission to "Inspire, Mobilize and Involve" fathers to become good influencers in their children’s lives for life.   
  
Being an active father is challenging, but all the more fulfilling. **Fathers@Gongshang** organise events and workshops to encourage Father-and-Child bonding. In a case where there is an absence of a father figure, any related male role model of the child is eligible to sign up for our activities.   
  
Fathers@Gongshang warmly welcomes all Fathers interested to volunteer their services!   
Do contact us via our  [Fathers@Gongshang Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/fathersat.gongshang) where photographs of past events are posted.
  
You are welcome to join us for any **Fathers@Gongshang** activity. Fathers, who are interested to help in logistics or any brainstorming, please contact Kelvin Leow, Chairperson of **Fathers@Gongshang**, [kelvinleowting@gmail.com](mailto:kelvinleowting@gmail.com) or 91081550.
