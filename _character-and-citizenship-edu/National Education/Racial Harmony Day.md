### **Racial Harmony Day**

Racial Harmony Day (RHD) is commemorated on 21 July.  It marks the race riots that broke out in Singapore on this day in 1964, reminding our pupils that social division weakens society, and that race and religion will always be potential fault-lines in Singapore’s society. It is a day for our pupils to reflect on and celebrate the nation’s success as a harmonious society, built on cultural diversity.
