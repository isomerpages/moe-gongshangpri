### **International Friendship Day**
International Friendship Day (IFD) is celebrated in schools on the third Friday of Term Two. This is a day dedicated to the understanding of Singapore's relations with its neighbours. It aims to nurture in our pupils the spirit of friendship and collaboration among different people of different nationalities.
