### **Learning Journey**
The Learning Journey initiative, which is a part of National Education, aims to help pupils understand and appreciate the role that the institutions visited play in the development and success of Singapore, and the challenges and constraints faced by Singapore.  The Learning Journey also allows our pupils to learn about the contributions by our pioneers to the development of Singapore as well as reinforce the following NE messages:

* Singapore is our homeland; this is where we belong.  
* We must preserve racial and religious harmony.  
* No one owes Singapore a living.  
* We have confidence in our future.
