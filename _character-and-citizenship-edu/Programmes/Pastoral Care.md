The Pastoral Care Team looks into the support of:

* Pupils who require social and emotional support 
* Pupils who require counselling 
* Pupils with Special Educational Needs (SEN)

Specialised classes and customised programmes are conducted for various groups of students, catering to their different social and emotional needs for eg School Transitional & Experiential Programme (STEP) for P1 and P6 students.

To encourage positive relationships among pupils, the following initiatives have been developed:-

* Friends@Gongshang
