### **Trips for International Experience (TIE)**
With the emphasis on developing 21st Century Competencies (21CC) in our students and the recognition that schools’ internationalisation efforts can strongly support the Desired Outcomes of Education, the Trips for International Experience (TIE) programme aims at meeting the following objectives :  
  
* Develop in our students the 21CC of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and  
* sensitivities;  
* Expose students to Asia and the world and sensitise them to the place of Singapore in the  
* world; and  
* Deepen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore.  
  
In 2019, the school organised 3 overseas trips for the P5 students.  Selected students went to Hong Kong, Vietnam and Penang.
