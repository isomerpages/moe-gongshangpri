### **Staff Professional Development**
#### **The Shared Mission**
The mission of professional development (PD) in Gongshang Primary School is to develop all staff with the necessary competencies and dispositions and to provide a quality learning experience to the learners. We strongly believe that such an experience is built on strong teacher-student relationships and on teachers being practitioners and reflective in their interactions with students. This is in alignment with the [Singapore Teaching Practice](https://www.moe.gov.sg/about/singapore-teaching-practice) **website unavailable** model.
