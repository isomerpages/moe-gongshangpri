### **Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)**
#### **Mission**
To nurture every child to be a concerned and gracious citizen, a confident leader with the right values.

The aim of education is the nurturing of the whole child. There are five main dimensions to every child:

1\. Intellectual<br>
2\. Physical<br>
3\. Moral<br>
4\. Social<br>
5. Emotional

These dimensions are closely linked to one another. Through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) the department facilitates the development of our students across these five dimensions. In CCE, we want our students to learn to be responsible learners as well as to develop an awareness and understanding of their roles in shaping the future of our nation.
