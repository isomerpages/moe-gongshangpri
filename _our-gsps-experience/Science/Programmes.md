### **Programmes**
Guided by the Primary Science Syllabus 2023, we aim to design learning experiences to prepare our pupils to be self-directed and collaborative learners, one who is able to acquire and manage information to meet challenges of globalisation and increased international competitiveness. Our Science learning programmes aim to provide opportunities for pupils to acquire scientific concepts and develop process skills and positive attitudes in alignment with curriculum needs and pupils’ interest and abilities.

#### **Every Child A Seed (In partnership with NParks)**
The programme, launched in 2013 as a key activity to commemorate 50 Years of Greening, is one of the programmes organised by NParks to involve school pupils in appreciating greenery. Through the programme, we seek to share with your child that Singapore’s greenery is a result of every Singaporean’s dedicated effort and that they too, can play a part in maintaining our City in a Garden.
 
We have planned for the programme to complement the Primary 3 Science topic on the life cycles of plants. Each Primary 3 pupil will receive a plant starter kit comprising a Plant Journal, a pot, seeds and potting mix. The Plant Journal contains simple instructions to teach the pupils how to grow and care for their plants. It also has simple activity sheets which the pupils can do. They can also share their plant stories with their classmates. 

#### **Earth Day 2021**
The school commemorated Earth Day on 22 April to celebrate the planet's environment and to raise public awareness about environmental issues. The theme of this year’s Earth Day is “Restore Our Earth”. Through the various programmes arranged, the pupils have come to an understanding that every action, no matter how small it may seem, counts towards restoring our earth.

**Project ‘Give-and-Share’:**&nbsp;The pupils have generously donated their pre-loved books and these books are given a new lease of life in their class library. Through this project, it has helped to instil the value of thrift as well as inculcate a culture of reading in our pupils.

#### **Inches for Pocket Money (In partnership with SPH)**
Primary 4 classes will observe the life cycle of a plant (Lady’s finger plant) through growing their own seed and caring for it. This is a meaningful project as every inch of the longest fruit produced will help raise funds for the less fortunate.

#### **Enrichment Programmes and Competitions**
Selected Primary 4 - 6 pupils who display a high interest and ability in Science will be introduced to enrichment activities and competitions to further develop their critical thinking and communication skills.
