### **Programmes**
The Science Department recognises that pupils need to be given a conducive environment and right guidance to be nurtured as critical thinkers and be driven to deeper learning in the areas they are passionate about. As such, the department strives to focus on the key strategic partnerships (the pupils, teachers and parents) to bring about learning success of the pupils.

Guided by the Primary Science Syllabus 2014, we aim to design learning experiences to prepare our pupils to be self-directed and collaborative learners, one who is able to acquire and manage information to meet challenges of globalisation and increased international competitiveness. Our Science learning programmes aim to provide opportunities for pupils to acquire scientific concepts and develop process skills and positive attitudes in alignment with curriculum needs and pupils’ interest and abilities.

The following table shows the themes covered in the respective levels.
