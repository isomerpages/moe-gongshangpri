### **The Student Learning Space**
The Student Learning Space was launched at the end of 2018 for all primary and secondary school students.  
  
This platform aims to enhance the learning of various subjects including science, history, social studies and mathematics.  
  
The SLS promotes self-directed learning where students learn at their own pace, revisit concepts and read up on other areas of interest. It also supports collaborative learning with features that allow the students to critique and comment on one another's responses for a more enhanced learning experience.
