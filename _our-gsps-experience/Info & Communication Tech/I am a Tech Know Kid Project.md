### **I Am a Tech-Know Kid Project**
Techno-Know Kid Project aims to expose our pupils to different aspects of cyber wellness. Upon the completion of various tasks in the Tech-Know Kid Booklet, pupils will be awarded a badge and a certificate.  
Through this project, pupils will learn to become responsible digital learners, demonstrate respect for self and others as well as practise safe and responsible use of technology.
