### **Code for Fun Programme**
#### **Code for Fun Programme for Primary 3-4 (2018-2019)**
_(This programme has been discontinued and replaced with a similar programme for every Primary 6 pupil starting from 2020.)_

As part of a national initiative to make Singapore a Smart Nation, Gongshang Primary School  organised Code for Fun (CFF) Enrichment Programme for all Primary 3 pupils in 2018 and 2019 to expose them to coding and computational thinking skills.

Code for Fun Enrichment Programme (a collaboration between IMDA and MOE) uses ‘simple logical reasoning, animation and academic learning of related concepts (algorithms and logical reasoning to solve problems by breaking them down in a fun way) through programming languages, such as Scratch and combining it with robotic kits.’

Objectives & Learning Outcomes 
* Understand the fundamentals of coding
* Write and run Scratch programmes
* Debug simple programmes
* Problem Decomposition
* Pattern Recognition, Generalization & Abstraction
* Data Analysis and Visualisation
* Self-Awareness and Responsible Decision Making
* Self-learning and to search for references or activities from the internet.

All participating pupils will complete 20 hours of coding training over a period of 2 years (2018-2019), which breaks down to 10 hours per year. The training for the CFF Enrichment Programme will be conducted in Term 1 of 2018 for Primary 3 and 2019 for Primary 4.

### **Code for Fun Programme for Primary 6 (2020)**
This is a collaboration between MOE and IMDA.

#### **MOE's Desired Outcomes**
* To develop, in majority of students, the basic computing literacy and skills that would enable them to become informed and responsible users of computing technology.  
* To grow a pool of students who have the talent and interest in Computing, so that they will take up the subject and subsequently pursue careers in related fields.

#### **Overview of Programme**
Fundamentals of Computational Thinking and Exposure to Emerging Technologies.<br>
Includes:  
* Hands-on coding with block programming languages;  
* Unplugged pedagogy activities  
* Coding challenges  
* Collaborative work in groups

All our Primary 6 students went through 10 hours of training for the Code for Fun Programme after PSLE.  All safe management measures including social distancing were adhered to.
