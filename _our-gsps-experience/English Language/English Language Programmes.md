### **English Language Programmes**
#### **English Language Fiesta**
Theme: Books bring us together

We celebrated English Language Week 2022 in Week 5 of Term 3, from 25 July 2022 to 1 August 2022. This event was organised to ignite the passion for reading and providing our students with a platform to explore the English Language further through fun and games.

Various language-based activities were held throughout the week. Students in Primary 1 and 2 were introduced to Nursery Rhymes while those in Primary 3 and 4 had to harness their creativity as they challenged themselves in a game of Idiom Charades. The Primary 5 and 6 students had to tap on their oracy skills as they journeyed through a game of synonyms.

The week-long activities culminated with the Dress as a Book Character Day on 1 August 2022. The students came dressed as their favourite book character. The school was abuzz as students, teachers and even our principals seized this opportunity to breathe life into various book characters. There was also a book talk during assembly by award-winning children’s author, Mr Neil Humphreys, which was well-received by everyone in the school.
