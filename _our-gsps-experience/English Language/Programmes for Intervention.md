### **Programmmes for Intervention**
We provide language and literacy support to our students who require the additional boost.

##### **Learning Support Programme (LSP) – Primary 1 and 2**

The LSP provides additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend lessons one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially trained school teachers using strategies that are specifically designed to improve their reading ability. 

##### **Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) – Primary 3**

The RRP caters to supporting P3 students who still face difficulties in reading in the English Language despite having been supported through the LSP programme in their earlier years. This specially designed programme introduced a range of different coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their daily learning.

##### **School Dyslexic Remediation (SDR) – Primary 3 and 4** 

The MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme catered exclusively for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia that is conducted at the end of Primary 2 by trained specialists. This after school programme is conducted in small groups by a trained school teacher using the remediation curriculum specifically designed by MOE Reading Specialists.
