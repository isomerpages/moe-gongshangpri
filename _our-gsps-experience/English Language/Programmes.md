STELLAR Curriculum (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading)

The STELLAR programme aims to strengthen language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning. At the heart of the STELLAR programme is the belief that enjoyment is a fundamental aspect of shared reading and writing experiences. Age-appropriate materials and research-based teaching strategies are used to engage students in the learning of English.

Teaching Strategies:
* Shared Book Approach (SBA)
* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
* Literacy Centres (LC)
* Explicit teaching of language items, structures and skills
* Show and Tell

### **Programmmes for Intervention**
We provide language and literacy support to our students who require the additional boost.

##### **Learning Support Programme (LSP) – Primary 1 and 2**

The LSP provides additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend lessons one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially trained school teachers using strategies that are specifically designed to improve their reading ability.&nbsp;

##### **Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) – Primary 3**

The RRP caters to supporting P3 students who still face difficulties in reading in the English Language despite having been supported through the LSP programme in their earlier years. This specially designed programme introduced a range of different coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their daily learning.

##### **School Dyslexic Remediation (SDR) – Primary 3 and 4** 

The MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme catered exclusively for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia that is conducted at the end of Primary 2 by trained specialists. This after school programme is conducted in small groups by a trained school teacher using the remediation curriculum specifically designed by MOE Reading Specialists.
