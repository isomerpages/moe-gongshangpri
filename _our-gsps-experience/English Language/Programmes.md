STELLAR Curriculum (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading)

The STELLAR programme aims to strengthen language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning. At the heart of the STELLAR programme is the belief that enjoyment is a fundamental aspect of shared reading and writing experiences. Age-appropriate materials and research-based teaching strategies are used to engage students in the learning of English.

Teaching Strategies:
* Shared Book Approach (SBA)
* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
* Literacy Centres (LC)
* Explicit teaching of language items, structures and skills
* Show and Tell
