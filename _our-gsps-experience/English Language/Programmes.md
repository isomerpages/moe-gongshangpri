### **Programmes**

##### **Core Programme**

STELLAR Curriculum (Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading)

The STELLAR programme aims to strengthen language and reading skills as well as promote a positive attitude towards learning. At the heart of the STELLAR programme is the belief that enjoyment is a fundamental aspect of shared reading and writing experiences. Age-appropriate materials and research-based teaching strategies are used to engage students in the learning of English.

Teaching Strategies:
* Shared Book Approach (SBA)
* Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA)
* Literacy Centres (LC)
* Explicit teaching of language items, structures and skills
* Show and Tell

### **Programmmes for Intervention**
We provide language and literacy support to our students who require the additional boost.

##### **Learning Support Programme (LSP) – Primary 1 and 2**

The LSP provides additional support for students with weak literacy skills. Students attend lessons one period a day in small groups, and are taught by specially trained school teachers using strategies that are specifically designed to improve their reading ability. 

##### **Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) – Primary 3**

The RRP caters to supporting P3 students who still face difficulties in reading in the English Language despite having been supported through the LSP programme in their earlier years. This specially designed programme introduced a range of different coping strategies for reading comprehension which will enable them to better manage their daily learning.

##### **School Dyslexic Remediation (SDR) – Primary 3 and 4** 

The MOE's School-based Dyslexia Remediation programme is a two-year intervention programme catered exclusively for Primary 3 and 4 students. These students are identified for support through a systematic screening process for dyslexia that is conducted at the end of Primary 2 by trained specialists. This after school programme is conducted in small groups by a trained school teacher using the remediation curriculum specifically designed by MOE Reading Specialists.

#### **English Language Fiesta**
Theme: Books bring us together

We celebrated English Language Week 2022 in Week 5 of Term 3, from 25 July 2022 to 1 August 2022. This event was organised to ignite the passion for reading and providing our students with a platform to explore the English Language further through fun and games.

Various language-based activities were held throughout the week. Students in Primary 1 and 2 were introduced to Nursery Rhymes while those in Primary 3 and 4 had to harness their creativity as they challenged themselves in a game of Idiom Charades. The Primary 5 and 6 students had to tap on their oracy skills as they journeyed through a game of synonyms.

The week-long activities culminated with the Dress as a Book Character Day on 1 August 2022. The students came dressed as their favourite book character. The school was abuzz as students, teachers and even our principals seized this opportunity to breathe life into various book characters. There was also a book talk during assembly by award-winning children’s author, Mr Neil Humphreys, which was well-received by everyone in the school.
