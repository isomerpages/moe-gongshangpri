**<center> Fluent Speakers Future Stars<br>
Developing Gongshangers into Effective Communicators</center>**

A two-tier programme that uses both English Language (EL) and Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) as the language mediums to scaffold Gongshangers' acquisition of speaking skills. We want to develop Gongshangers to communicate effectively and speak with confidence and purpose.
